# Subsetting of tumor cells from snATAC and multiome objects.

## Analyses:

1. ```snATAC``` -- Subsetting of tumor cells from snATAC objects (cases with paired snRNA/snATAC) and further re-clustering, dim. reduction. Also, transfer of snRNA cluster labels to snATAC tumor cells.

Note: this procedure was first developed and used in SN CCRCC analysis.


2. ```Multiome``` -- Subsetting of tumor cells from multiome objects and further re-clustering, dim. reduction.
